# Project - README

This is the [Final Project] for [CSE 20289 Systems Programming (Spring 2019)].

## 2020 Note
This read me is the required deliverable for my final project for Systems Programming. The project used C to develop a server program using sockets and forking to allow clients to connect to the site. It used basic HTML to host text files of various sizes, images, and run scripts. We also created a python script called Thor.py to hammer the server code.

## Errata

Summary of things that don't work (quite right).

    Overall, it appears that our project works as required. We were able to pass all tests including
the Valgrind tests. However, if we had more time, our program encounters an error when the port 
was just previously bound to. This error was discussed in class and was inevitable to avoid. Yet, 
depending upon the mode, our code runs into a segfault which is not supposed to happen. This is a 
result of some error checking (we think), but we would try to fix that if we had more time. For now,
we are assuming that we will not run into this issue as we bind to new ports each time. Everything
else appears to work great!
